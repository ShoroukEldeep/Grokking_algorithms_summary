# Grokking_algorithms_summary

Hello guys, Grokking Algorithms is a fully illustrated, friendly guide that teaches you how to apply common algorithms to the practical problems you face every day as a programmer. You'll start with tasks like sorting and searching. As you build up your skills, you'll tackle more complex problems like data compression and artificial intelligence. Each carefully presented example includes helpful diagrams and fully annotated code samples in Python. By the end of this book, you will have mastered widely applicable algorithms as well as how and when to use them.

**About the Technology**
> An algorithm is nothing more than a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem. The algorithms you'll use most often as a programmer have already been discovered, tested, and proven. If you want to understand them but refuse to slog through dense multipage proofs, this is the book for you. This fully illustrated and engaging guide makes it easy to learn how to use the most important algorithms effectively in your own programs.

**What's Inside**
- Covers search, sort, and graph algorithms
- Over 400 pictures with detailed walkthroughs
- Performance trade-offs between algorithms
- Python-based code samples

**Note** : *"This is not just another book on algorithms but one of the most interesting books you will ever read on Algorithms and Data structure, particularly for beginners."
